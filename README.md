# APITesting

API REST skeleton used for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/davellanedam/node-express-mongodb-jwt-rest-api-skeleton). [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) with [Chai Assertion Library](https://www.chaijs.com/) is used.


The project consists of a collection of different HTTP requests divided into categories: auth, city, profile, user and a series of test scripts for each category. 

The whole project was run on the local machine. 
* Requirements for localhost: 
  * Node.js 10+
  * MongoDB 3.6+
  * Redis 5.0+
